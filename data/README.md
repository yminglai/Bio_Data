# Bio Data Generator

This project generates synthetic biographical data, including biographies and corresponding question-answer pairs. It's designed to create a dataset for tasks like information extraction, question answering, and text generation.

## How it Works

The `db_gen.py` script is the core of this project. It works by:

1.  **Loading Data:** It reads names, cities, universities, majors, and companies from the text files in the `entities` directory.
2.  **Generating People:** It creates a specified number of unique individuals by combining a first, middle, and last name.
3.  **Creating Biographies:** For each person, it generates a short biography using templates from the `templates` directory. These biographies include details like birth date, university, major, and employer.
4.  **Generating Q&A Pairs:** It creates a set of question-answer pairs for each person based on their biographical data, using templates from the `qa_templates` directory.
5.  **Writing Output:** The script writes the generated data to three files:
    *   `output.csv`: A CSV file containing the structured biographical data.
    *   `bio.txt`: A text file with the generated biographies.
    *   `qa.txt`: A text file with the generated question-answer pairs.

## How to Use

To generate the data, simply run the `db_gen.py` script:

```bash
python db_gen.py
```

This will create the `output.csv`, `bio.txt`, and `qa.txt` files in the current directory. You can adjust the number of entries to generate by modifying the `num_entries` variable in the `main` function of the script.

## Sample Output

Here are some examples of the data generated by the script.
